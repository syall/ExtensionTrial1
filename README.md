# Extension Trial 1
HackRU Spring 2018 April 21-22

We are experimenting with making Chrome extensions.

This is a one use timer, in which you must stay on the tab to use.

This is good for test taking practice online, as you are forced to stay on the page or else the timer will reset.

There are several options to add the minutes up to the desired length of time.

To use this, do this (only on Chrome and having a git)...
- Use the command line: $ git clone https://github.com/syall/ExtensionTrial1.git
- After that, go to the Extensions options in the Chrome browser
- Turn on Developer Mode
- In the Load Unpacked section, load in the folder that was cloned
- It should be ready to use!

This is our first attempt at a Chrome extension, so please bear with us.
