# Basically, here is our plan:
- Use icon.png for the image
- popup.js for all of the color and timer logic
- manifest.json for all permissions
- popup.html for the layout of the buttons and display
- main.css for the aesthetics
- background.js is not really used (maybe for the future)
- timer.js was a separate file that was later combined with the current popup.js for all timer logic
